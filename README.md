CppNumericalSolvers
===================

This repository contains some solvers written in C++11 using the eigen3 library for linear algebra.

There are currently the following solvers:
- gradient descent solver
- Newton descent solver
- BFGS solver
- L-BFGS solver
- L-BFGS-B solver

Additional helpful functions are

- check gradient
- compute gradient by finite differences
- compute Hessian matrix by finite differences

There is a simple "unittest" inside (minimization of the Rosenbrock function). By convention these solvers minimize a function.

Usage
----------
You only have to define c++11-functionals for calculating the function value and gradient:

```
auto function_value = [] (const Vector &x) -> double {};
auto gradient_value = [] (const Vector x, Vector &grad) -> void {};
```

While I discourage you from using the numerical approximation of the gradient, the definition of the gradient functional is *optional*. To use `Newton Descent` without explicitly computing the Hessian matrix you should use `computeHessian` from `Meta.h`.
To optimize (minimize) the function you can use:

```
Vector x0;                  // initial guess
LbfgsSolver lbfgs;      // choose a solver
lbfgs.Solve(x0,function_value,gradient_value);
// or using a numerical approximation of the gradient
lbfgs.Solve(x0,function_value);
// or newton
auto hessian_value = [&](const Vector x, Matrix & hes) -> void
{
    hes = Matrix::Zero(x.rows(), x.rows());
    computeHessian(function_value, x, hes);
};
NewtonDescentSolver newton;      // or use newton descent
newton.Solve(x0,function_value,gradient_value,hessian_value);
```

I encourage you to check you gradient by 
```
checkGradient(YOUR-OBJECTIVE-FUNCTION, X, A-SAMPLE-GRADIENT-VECTOR_FROM-YOUR-FUNCTIONAL);
```

full sample
----------------
```
int main(void) {

	// create function
	auto rosenbrock = [] (const Vector &x) -> double {
		const double t1 = (1-x[0]);
		const double t2 = (x[1]-x[0]*x[0]);
		return   t1*t1 + 100*t2*t2;
	};

	// create derivative of function
	auto Drosenbrock = [] (const Vector x, Vector &grad) -> void {
		grad[0]  = -2*(1-x[0])+200*(x[1]-x[0]*x[0])*(-2*x[0]);
		grad[1]  = 200*(x[1]-x[0]*x[0]);
	};

	// initial guess
	Vector x0(2);x0 << 1,2;
	// get derivative
	Vector dx0(2);
	Drosenbrock(x0,dx0);
	// verify gradient by finite differences
	checkGradient(rosenbrock,x0,dx0);

	// use solver (GradientDescentSolver,BfgsSolver,LbfgsSolver,LbfgsbSolver)
	LbfgsSolver g;
	g.Solve(x0,rosenbrock,Drosenbrock);

	std::cout << std::endl<<std::endl<< x0.transpose();

	return 0;
}
```
